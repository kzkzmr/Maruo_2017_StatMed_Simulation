## Simulation setting variables

cov = 0: no covariate, 1: with covariate (baseline); cov = 1 for all simulations.

sgn = -1: sign of true treatment effect is minus, sgn = 1: plus; sgn = 1 for all simulations. 

lambda (only for PN) = -0.5, 0, or 0.5

wg (only for WG) = 0: Weibull distribution, 1: gamma distribution

H = 0: null hypothesis for all visit, 1: null hypothes only for last visit, 2: alternative hypothesis

For detail simulation settings, see Maruo et al. (2017).
